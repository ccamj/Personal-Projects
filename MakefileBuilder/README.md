## Synopsis

A GUI program created in java designed to help create a makefile as fast and easy as possible. I decided to create this to speed up my C++ project creation for school.


## Installation

This project was created in Java and includes a multiplatform executable JAR file. The file can be launched the following ways:
1. command line: $./java -jar makebuilder.jar
2. If you have Java Runtime Enviorment on your system, right click the JAR and set it to open with your JRE.


## File Layout
This project contains three source files: Builder.java(main), NewSource.java, and NewHeader.java

Other files: screenshot.png, makebuilder.jar, mfilebuilder.png (program icon in resource folder)
